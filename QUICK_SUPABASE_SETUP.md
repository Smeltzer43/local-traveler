# 🚨 URGENT: Supabase Auth Setup Required

## The Problem
Your magic links aren't being sent because Supabase Auth isn't configured yet. Follow these steps:

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Go to Your Supabase Dashboard
- Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Click on your project: `jxytzukoqwmcrlldsbpo`

### 2. Enable Email Authentication
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Under **Auth Providers**, make sure **Email** is **ENABLED**
3. If it's disabled, click the toggle to enable it

### 3. Configure Site URL
1. In the same **Authentication** → **Settings** page
2. Set **Site URL** to: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**:
   - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/learnmore.html`
   - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

### 4. Check Email Settings
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Scroll down to **SMTP Settings**
3. Make sure **Enable custom SMTP** is OFF (use Supabase default for now)
4. Or configure your own SMTP if you have one

### 5. Test the Flow
1. Open your site: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
2. Fill out the popup form
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Check your email (including spam folder)

## 🐛 Debugging Steps

### If you get an error:
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Fill out the form** and submit
3. **Look for error messages** in console
4. **Common errors:**
   - "Email not confirmed" → Enable email auth
   - "Invalid redirect URL" → Add redirect URLs
   - "SMTP not configured" → Check email settings

### Check Supabase Logs:
1. Go to **Logs** → **Auth** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Look for any error messages when you submit the form

## 📧 Email Troubleshooting

### If no email is received:
1. **Check spam/junk folder**
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (sometimes delayed)
3. **Check Supabase logs** for email sending errors
4. **Try a different email address**

### If email is received but link doesn't work:
1. **Check redirect URLs** are correct
2. **Make sure learnmore.html exists**
3. **Check browser console** for auth errors

## 🚀 Quick Test

1. **Submit the form** with your email
2. **Check console** for "Magic link sent successfully"
3. **Check email** for the magic link
4. **Click the link** - should go to learnmore.html

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If it's still not working after these steps:
1. **Screenshot the browser console errors**
2. **Check Supabase dashboard logs**
3. **Verify your Supabase project is active** (not paused)

The most common issue is that **Email authentication is not enabled** in your Supabase project settings.
